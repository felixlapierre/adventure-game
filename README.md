# adventure-game
Adventure game, created in C++ using SFML, by Felix Lapierre.
2018

This is a work in progress port of my Mox Arena game from C# to C++. I took on this project mostly because I wanted to learn C++. Also, I wrote Mox Arena when I was new to programming and there are many terrible programming practices there.

This version of the project has far fewer features than the C# game, and is a huge work in progress. It is not currently in development.
